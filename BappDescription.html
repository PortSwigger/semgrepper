<p>The extension integrates Semgrep static analysis into passive scanning, allowing users to apply custom Semgrep rules against HTTP responses. It enables security testing based on community-contributed rulesets, particularly useful for detecting client-side issues in JavaScript and other front-end technologies.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple tabs for organizing different Semgrep rules and scopes</li>
  <li>Select individual files or entire directories of Semgrep YAML rule files</li>
  <li>Configure scope conditions based on presence or absence of content in response headers or body</li>
  <li>Enable or disable rule checks without unloading the extension</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This extension requires the Semgrep CLI to be installed on your system.</p>
<p>For Ubuntu, Windows through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Linux, macOS:</p>
<pre><code class="Code">python3 -m pip install semgrep</code></pre>
<p>For macOS:</p>
<pre><code class="Code">brew install semgrep</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In the "Rules Files" tab, choose the Semgrep YAML rules you want to apply.</li>
  <li>In the "Scope" tab, set conditions that determine whether a rule applies to a specific response.</li>
  <li>Use the toggle switch to activate or deactivate scanning for the current tab.</li>
  <li>Passive scanning will apply the selected Semgrep rules to matching responses based on the defined scope.</li>
</ol>
